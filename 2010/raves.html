              What can I say about Brad Cerasani... other than what a remarkable
              person, number one, and secondly what an incredible photographer!
              I only recently got to know Brad, and in that short time I
              realized what an asset he has been to our organization, the TJ's
              Gift Foundation. Our Foundation is very personal to my family, as
              it was formed after the murder of our 20 year old son, T.J. Wiebe.
              This "personal" feeling affects everything we do, and Brad's
              photography brought that feeling even closer. At our "Rockin for
              Choices" concert at MTS Centre, Brad took incredible shots that
              captured the event like no one else could have. There is one
              particular shot he took of my wife and I addressing the crowd...
              It was perfect... He chose a certain position to capture that
              "personal" feeling, with the stage lights that spotlighted that
              "personal" touch. Brad is one of the only photographers I have met
              that actually has his heart in every shot he takes. Thank you so
              much Brad...
            </p>

              The work is 2nd to none. The pictures you captured of the All
              Access Music series with Brent Fitz were the best we had all tour!
              It really captured what we are trying to do with this series and
              It shone an amazing light on what Dave has created with his Drum
              Talk sessions. Thanks again and I can't wait to see what you have

            <p>Brad,</p>
            <p>
              Just thought I’d drop you a note regarding all the unbelievable
              work you have done for us. As you already know, our web experience
              was extremely limited, but you managed to speak a language we
              could understand. My father and I had previously started with a
              different web company that took over a year and countless dollars
              before we finally gave up. That’s when you stepped in. You listen
              to us, evaluated our needs and took over from there. You explained
              things we needed to know (even something’s we didn’t.…code) but
              that was our fault for asking. You guided us through the entire
              process, making positive suggestions along the way, exceeding all
              of our expectations. We quickly learned to trust your experience,
              expertise and integrity. As far as your photography, it is
              amazing. How you can get that perfect picture every time, I’ll
              never know (all that fancy equipment I’m sure helps). Our website
              (also being maintained by you) has been up for a while now and is
              generating all kinds of leads and activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Thank you for all your help” does not seem to do justice for
              everything you have done, but that and a “Cheque” I’m sure helps.
            </p>

              Whenever we're in need of new band photo's we know just who to
              call! Brad is an extremely talented and versatile photographer who
              can capture an image like no other. We've used his services
              multiple times now and have always been very impressed by the
              quality of both his photo's and his dedication to getting a great
              shot. Whether it means getting soaking all wet lying down in dewy
              grass, or fighting off swarms of mosquitoes, Brad will get the
              shot! I highly recommend his services - he is great at what he
              does and is a pleasure to work with.

              during the last few years, and have nothing but great things to
              say about him. His work ethic is astounding, and you will notice
